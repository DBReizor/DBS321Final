                    AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a technology that enables computers and other 
                    various devices to perform advanced functions, including understanding our 
                    languages and responding to our questions/thoughts. AI has been around for a 
                    while now, integrating into a lot of different aspects of our lives. It's usage 
                    has many advantages and disadvantages.

                    AI can give users a personalized learning experience, knowing how to answer questions
                    based on how they were asked. AI has also been made very accesible. One of the largest 
                    AI prompt-response models is chatGPT, usable by anyone who makes an account on their site. 
                    ChatGPT also has a very large dataset that it gathers its information from, saving its users
                    time that would otherwise be spent looking for reliable info. It's disadvantages -

                <p>
                    Education is one big aspect of our lives that AI has intertwined with. The use of
                    AI has increased exponentially in the past couple of years with schools. 
                    It is an exciting tool to explore, but it does raise some concerns in the education 
                    world.

                    AI is partly trained on knowledge that has been proven wrong. Some of the results that ChatGPT 
                    has provided have also been proven wrong. The garbage that has been put into the tool 
                    risks the output also being garbage. It's hard to trust something like that to do 
                    your assignments when it has been wrong and sometimes biased in its outputs in the past.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    AI has also been overused and is considered by some teachers as a tool to cheat. 
                    Lots of students depend way too much on AI to do all of their homework. It's the 
                    easy way out for people who don't want to do their assignments.  It's important to 
                    be able to learn on your own and have the right information to study. Having AI as 
                    an option is the perfect escape for students to skip over doing their assignments and 
                    gaining problem solving skills that would help them later in life.

                        Teachers are a big part of education; we learn almost everything from them, including 
                        life skills, teamwork, and time management. We have covered the impact of AI on 
                        education regarding students based on outside researchâ€¦ but what are teachers thoguhts 
                        on the subject? Studies have shown that a lot of teachers have adapted to using AI in 
                        helping them with their lessons plans and grading. Both of which activities are very 
                        time-consuming for teachers. It is undoubtedly a helpful tool in making these jobs 
                        easier and faster.

                        Other teachers have spoken about how AI is setting back students in terms of learning 
                        material that will be useful later in life. A lot of educators are worried that students are 
                        losing the general skill of learning. They are receiving assignments sometimes entirely 
                        done by AI, it makes educators feel like they are just wasting their time teaching.

                            I believe students already have too many readily available resources, such as answers 
                            to tests, essays, reports, etc. AI just makes it even easier for students to gain 
                            answers without gaining knowledge.

                        There is no doubt about it that AI will change education forever. It has already 
                        changed our beliefs about education.  Students use AI to get through school easily, 
                        without having to put much effort into learning the material that they are presented with.
                        All kinds of technology can be useful, yet harmful, including AI. It all depends on how we 
                        use it. The future of AI use can be bright if we don't misuse it. If we use it to our 
                        advantage by effectively supplying the right information to classrooms and 
                        engaging students with AI in a better manner, it could make a big difference.
